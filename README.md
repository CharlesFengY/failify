# Failify

Failify is a tool for end-to-end regression testing of distributed systems. It can enforce a specific order in operations in different nodes and simulate node and network failure. It is especially important when the sequence of operations in different nodes can be undeterministic and a bug can occur only in a specific sequence. Also, it can be used to inject node and network failures in a specific time.
